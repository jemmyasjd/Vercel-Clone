## INTRODUCTION üåü

Welcome to the Vercel Clone project! This project aims to replicate the core functionalities of Vercel, a popular platform for deploying and managing web applications. This Vercel clone provides a robust and scalable solution for developers to deploy their applications seamlessly, leveraging modern technologies and cloud services.

The project architecture includes various components such as an API server, build server, socket server, and a reverse proxy setup, all orchestrated using AWS services like ECS, ECR, and S3 storage. This setup ensures efficient handling of build processes, real-time updates, and secure storage, making it an ideal solution for modern web development needs.

## What It Does !! üë∑

This project provides a comprehensive platform for deploying and managing web applications with ease. It replicates the core functionalities of Vercel, offering a seamless experience for developers.

## How I Build üîß

- **Backend Development:** the backend is developed using Express.js to handle API requests and manage server-side logic.

- **Frontend Development:** The frontend has been developed using the next-js calling the api to the backend.

- **API Server:** The API server was built to handle project creation and task execution, integrating AWS ECS for running tasks and Redis for real-time logging and communication.

- **Build Server:** The build server automates the process of installing dependencies, building the project, and uploading the built files to AWS S3. It uses Redis for real-time logging and AWS SDK for S3 interactions.

- **S3 Reverse Proxy:** Configured a reverse proxy using Express.js and http-proxy to route incoming requests to the appropriate resources stored in AWS S3, ensuring efficient handling of static assets.

- **Real-Time Communication:** Utilized Socket.io to enable real-time updates and communication between the server and clients, ensuring that changes are instantly reflected across the platform.

- **AWS Integration:** Leveraged AWS ECS for container orchestration, ECR for storing Docker images, and S3 for secure and scalable storage of static assets.

- **Containerization:** Created Dockerfiles for each component to containerize the applications, ensuring consistent and isolated environments for deployment.

## Challenges I Ran Into üíÄ

- **Real-Time Communication:** Initially, I faced difficulties in establishing real-time communication for fetching logs. Ensuring that the logs were updated in real-time required meticulous handling and optimization of the socket server.
- **CORS Errors:** When making POST requests, I encountered CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors. This required updating the server configuration to include appropriate CORS headers, allowing cross-origin requests and resolving the issue.
- **AWS Integration:** Integrating AWS services such as ECS, ECR, and S3 posed challenges, especially in configuring the network and security settings and interacting with the AWS SDK client.

## Architecture Explanation ‚ò£Ô∏è

- **Frontend to Backend Communication:**
  - The frontend sends a POST request containing the GitHub URL to the backend server.
- **Dynamic Docker Container Creation:**
  - Instead of cloning the GitHub repository directly on the server, the backend spins up a Docker container for each GitHub repository.
  - The code is cloned into these isolated Docker containers, allowing for scalability and parallel execution of multiple repositories.
- **Centralized Storage:**
  - Once the code is cloned and built within the Docker container, the generated output is stored in a centralized AWS S3 bucket.
- **Real-Time Log Streaming:**
  - During the build process, logs are generated and published to Redis.
  - Users can subscribe to these logs via Socket.io, receiving real-time updates on the build status.
- **Accessing Built Files:**
  - After the build process is complete, the built files can be accessed through a reverse proxy, which routes requests to the appropriate resources.
